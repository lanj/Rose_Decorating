   <h3 class="red">Introduction </h3>
   <p> Lulant is an IT consultancy based in London. The reason for setting it up involved the observation of the difficulty a     lot of companies had with offshoring IT related work to offshore centers in India and China.</p> <p> While 10 years ago it made sense to outsource these core services, today the wage increases in these countries mitigate against the trend. In fact we are now seeing a reversal of the trend due to the cost benefit not matching up to the hype.</p><p>Our services encompass software development, network installation, IT audit of IT infrastructure and project management.</p>
<p>Our customer focus will be on the SME market which tends to have a lot of IT services that are more cost effective when outsourced. In the current business climate, companies will look to squeeze as much efficiency from their bottom line as possible. Lulant will save companies money in the short and long term. Companies will benefit from being able to use us for specific well defined projects that are delivered on time and on budget.
